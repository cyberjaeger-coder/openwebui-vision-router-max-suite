# openwebui-vision-router-max-suite
Vision Quality Router Suite adds reliable image handling to any text LLM in Open WebUI using an Ollama vision side-call. It prioritizes accuracy and clarification over guessing: structured output, quality gating, optional OCR pass, and an optional verifier pass. Includes follow-up pipes for missing details and graph/diagram structure extraction.
